      **What is Dr. John's philosophy about chiropractic?**


      Professionalism: At Keystone Healing Arts, He strives to treat every patient with respect and compassion. He takes your concerns, problems, and symptoms seriously.  He will listen and treat you with respect and professionalism.


      Program:  Dr. John will formulate a program that will address your healthcare concerns in the best way possible. This can involve chiropractic adjustments, at-home exercise, or other therapy. He wants to make sure that you are getting the personalized care that you deserve. 


      Perspective:  Dr. John likes to take a broad view of your particular health concerns.  One of the most powerful and limiting aspects of traditional medicine is specialization.  A specialist doctor knows a great deal about a very small part of the body.  At Keystone Healing Art Center, Dr. John looks at the body as a whole to try and determine the cause of your problem and get to the bottom of it, rather than just focusing on the area of pain while perhaps missing other involved factors.


      Priority: You, the patient, are our priority.  Dr. John focuses on finding a way to help you reach your health goals as quickly and economically as possible.


      Promise: Dr. John promises to give an honest assessment of your health needs - whether that includes his services or not. His priority is helping you on your wellness journey.


      **What makes our care and methods different?** 


      Unlike most healthcare professionals, Dr. John patiently takes the time that is needed to really hear about a person’s concerns and problems.  He listens and formulates a plan of action that may or may not include his services.  He wants to make sure that you are getting what you need.
