        quote: I never understood Chiropractic care until I became a patient of Dr.
          Stansbury. His ability to address even the smallest misalignments I
          wouldn‚Äôt know existed is remarkable. He‚Äôs treated me for TMJ and
          excruciating back pain, and every time the healing was close to
          immediate.

        quote: Gets to know my body and helps prevent injury on body parts I didn't know
          were bothering me until he fixes them. After trying 3 chiropractors in
          the area, he is definitely the best.

        quote: Dr. Stansbury is a very thorough patient chiropractor covering
          misalignments frequently missed by others. The location is a bit
          out-of-the-way but it is worth it. Unfortunately at the moment he is
          out of network for insurance but it's still generally affordable.
