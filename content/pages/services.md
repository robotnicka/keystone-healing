      What is AK?


      The Triad of Health represents the three basic causes of health problems - Structural, Chemical, and Mental. Applied Kinesiology is a diagnostic technique that evaluates the Triad of Health using manual muscle testing. By using Applied Kinesiology, Dr. John can evaluate the body non-invasively to identify the root causes of health problems.


      What is SOT?


      SacroOccipital Technique. Major Bertrand Dejarnette developed the technique after coming to understand the interconnected relationship between the sacrum (the base of your spine) and the occipital (the base of your skull). With this understanding, he realized there were other interconnected relationships between parts of the body that might not be close to each other or obviously related. By understanding these relationships, diagnosing symptoms is expedited allowing Dr. John to get to the net root of the problem faster than conventional approaches


      LLLLT (Low-Level Laser Light Therapy)


      LLLLT when properly applied, can decrease pain, speed healing, and increase blood flow to a painful or damaged area of the body.

      Percussor therapy


      Is used in every treatment to release and relieve problems in interconnective tissue.

      This helps ease and maintain adjustments as well as targeting specific problems in muscles and tendons.


      Extremity


      Many chiropractors focus on the spine, but Dr. John recognizes that chiropractic can help the entire body. Much like the children’s song, your knee bone is connected to your thigh bone and your thigh bone is connected to your hip bone and your hip bone is connected your back bone. By treated problems down the line, you can alleviate and prevent seemingly unrelated issues. Because Dr. John takes this whole body approach, he has cultivated the knowledge to treat many different issues like sports injuries or repeated stress injuries like tendonitis or carpal tunnel.   

      TMJ protocol


      Dr. John has partnered with local dentists to treat TMJ pain and dysfunction. By partnering with other healthcare professionals, Dr. John can develop a treatment plan for each patient's specific needs. 


      Pediatric


      Dr. John has treated children as young as a few hours old all the way to adulthood. He recognizes that children are not tiny adults. A careful gentle approach is necessary to treat their growing bodies.The birthing process can be traumatic and with simple gentle adjustments problems can be corrected that cause issues with ear infections, headaches, problems with latching and many more. As kids grow, they play hard and joints can be loose from growth. This combination can result in joint problems. Regular adjustments can relieve pain and avoid complex medical procedures.  


      Pregnancy


      The body changes and is stressed during pregnancy. Chiropractic care has been shown to alleviate the aches and pains that go along with pregnancy and may shorten delivery times and decrease the likelihood of complications during delivery. Dr. John has worked with many new moms through their entire pregnancy journey.
